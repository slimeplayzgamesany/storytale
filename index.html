            <h2 class="text"> One day, by the side of the road, Luna found a bottle of 
                starlights. It shimmered and glistened in pinpricks of light
                 and whispering glimmers. It was smoky blue and Beautiful. 
                 Lune leaned over. She wanted to see it more closely.</h2>

                But when she tried to pick up the bottle, it slipped from her fingers and smashed. 
                With a wild giggle, the stars streaked from the glass and escaped into the sky.

            <h2 class="text1">Luna cried and leapt as she tried to catch the stars. They laughed at her from 
                their places so high in the air. From above, Luna's dancing made her look like 
                an angry little ant. They knew she couldn't reach them, and they were happy to
                 be free. For the stars had been so long in the bottle that the air around 
                 them felt cool and wide. They gleamed. It was so nice to be in that vast black
                  universe, with space to twinkle and breathe.</h2>

           <h2 class="text1"> The bottle lay in shards of dark glass at Luna's feet. She scooped up 
            the pieces of glass and put them in her pocket. She felt a need to hide
             what she had done. She didn't know who the stars belonged to, and if 
             the owner would be angry when they found out what had Happened. </h2>

                    glance fell upon a long vine hanging quietly from a nearby tree. Being
                    a thrifty elf, she found it no trouble to fashion a lasso and throw it high into the air.
                    But the lasso was lazy and limp. It plummeted to the ground in a matter
                    of Moments.

                    Next her eyes wandered to a giant tree. Perhaps if she leapt and 
                    caught them in her fingers, she thought....? But climbing high 
                    into the limbs of the tree, she realized that she was no more 
                    airy than the vine had been. Lacking wings, she thumped into the
                    earth like a heavy sack.

                    The stars twittered and the passing birds sniggered mirthfully. 
                    The ladybirds rumbled sly little laughs. It felt that nobody 
                    would help Luna return the stars, and were all having a good joke 
                    at her expense. Luna sat on a stump and began to cry.

                    At just that moment, a tiny rabbit poked its head from the bushes
                     and sniffed the air. It had heard Luna's sobbing and wanted to
                      know what was the matter. "Why are you crying?" the rabbit asked 
                      the elf.

                    "I found a bottle, and accidentally dropped it. All the stars 
                    escaped," said Luna tearfully. “Ahh, but that's no reason to cry,"
                     said the rabbit. "What good does crying do?" "Perhaps if I cry 
                     enough, I will make a lake, and float high enough to catch them,"
                      Luna sniffed.

                    The little rabbit leaned back against a leaf. “It seems to me that
                     there are too many," he said. "Even if you could reach them. 
                     There's just some things you can't do. You can't collect all 
                     the grains of sand on a beach. You can't drink all the water in
                      all the sea." "You will not be able to capture all those stars
                       and put them back,” he said.

                    passion overtook her. She stamped her foot. "Oh I wish I could
                     take time back!" she said. "I wish I had never touched that

                    clover which he had retrieved from behind his ear. "Nothing can
                     be taken back. Once something is, it just is. "I "Like the wind
                      and the sunrise; like love and loss. It just is. You can't help

                    this bottle?" she asked at last. "It's all broken. It won't work

                       of boastfulness, they leapt to the earth in a bright streak,
                        where they plummeted earthwards, falling into cracks in rocks,
                         lakes, sand and furze. But that is another story.</h2>

                    In the present, Luna sat on the mossy ground and took the shards from her pocket. She lay them in the shape of the bottle, but they would no longer take the shape they had once had. So she began to play with them. Soon she found they could make a skyscraper... a window... a puddle...
